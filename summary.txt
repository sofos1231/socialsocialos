üìú SUMMARY MASTER PROMPT ‚Äì SOCIALGYM

You are working on **SOCIALGYM** ‚Äî a flagship, premium mobile-only gamified social skills training app built in **React Native + Expo Go**.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ PURPOSE
Your mission is to rebuild and adapt all UI/UX from the **Lovable web version** stored in:
üìÇ social-spark-gym-main

The output must be the **pixel-perfect, production-ready React Native equivalent**, placed in:
üìÇ socialsocial

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ BEFORE EVERY TASK ‚Äì MANDATORY STEPS
Before writing a single line of code, you must:
1. **Read and follow**: `initialization prompt.txt` (full build rules, structure, and standards).
2. **Read and follow**: `quality check.txt` (non-negotiable visual, UX, and code quality rules).
3. **Check**: The reference UI in `social-spark-gym-main` for layout, design, and interactions.
4. **Confirm**: That the output will compile and run in Expo Go without errors.

If any of the above is missing or unclear ‚Äî STOP and ask for clarification before building.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ HOW TO WORK
- **Always** search for matching or related files inside `social-spark-gym-main` before coding.
- Use them as **reference only**, never copy incompatible web code directly.
- Translate to **React Native primitives**: View, Text, TouchableOpacity, Image, ScrollView, FlatList, Animated.View.
- Use only allowed libraries: expo-linear-gradient, react-native-svg, react-navigation, reanimated.
- All styles must use `StyleSheet.create()` or a styles object inside the same file.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
You must **merge** the rules from `initialization prompt.txt` and `quality check.txt` into every task.

That means:
- Premium, modern, and polished design
- Pixel-perfect spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy
- Microinteractions (animations, haptics, feedback)
- No placeholder or dead UI
- Must match or exceed the quality of Duolingo, Clash Royale, Lerna, or Apple Fitness

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ FILE CREATION RULES
- Place all **components** in `/components/`
- Place all **screens** in `/screens/`
- Place all **assets** in `/assets/`
- Maintain clean, reusable, modular code
- Separate logic from styles when appropriate

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ ABSOLUTE NO-GO RULES
‚ùå Do NOT use HTML tags like div, span, section, input
‚ùå Do NOT use web-specific APIs (window, document)
‚ùå Do NOT skip reading the prompts
‚ùå Do NOT deliver unpolished or incomplete code

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ SUCCESS CRITERIA
‚úÖ Pixel-perfect visual match to `social-spark-gym-main`
‚úÖ Runs flawlessly in Expo Go with no errors
‚úÖ Follows **all** quality rules and standards
‚úÖ Uses animations and feedback for a delightful UX
‚úÖ Is mobile-optimized and responsive for all iPhone sizes

---

üöÄ **REMEMBER**: Before starting **any** coding task ‚Äî read `initialization prompt.txt` and `quality check.txt` completely, check references in `social-spark-gym-main`, then build in `socialsocial`.

This process is **mandatory** for every single component, screen, or feature.
