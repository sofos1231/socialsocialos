📑 quality check.txt — SOCIALGYM (Builder Mode, Extended)

This file defines the non-negotiable quality gates for every single output you deliver when building SOCIALGYM.
You must validate against this checklist before returning any results.
If any single requirement fails, you must fix it immediately before delivering your response.

1️⃣ COMPILATION & CONFIG

 The project must run in Expo Go without errors.

 Code must be in TypeScript (.ts/.tsx) only. No .js files.

 npx tsc --noEmit passes cleanly (no type errors).

 npx expo-doctor reports no blocking issues.

 If animations are used, babel.config.js contains react-native-reanimated/plugin as the last plugin.

 No missing dependencies — if new libraries are used, npx expo install ... is shown.

2️⃣ CODE & STRUCTURE

 Every response starts with exact shell commands (cd, mkdir -p, touch, npx expo install ...).

 All changed files are shown in full (no snippets, no ellipses, no “insert here”).

 No placeholders, no TODO, no unfinished code.

 No HTML tags (div, span, input, etc.).

 No web APIs (window, document, localStorage).

 Every new route, context, or state shape introduced is explained clearly.

 Code is modular, reusable, and cleanly organized.

3️⃣ VISUAL & UX

 The result must be pixel-perfect compared to the user’s description or provided images.

 All visuals meet the SocialGym standard:

Glossy 3D coins

Faceted cyan diamonds

Polished streak flame with glow and rim light

 Consistent hierarchy: typography, spacing, and layout follow a clear scale.

 Gradients, shadows, and radii are premium and modern (Clash Royale / Duolingo / Apple Fitness level polish).

 Microinteractions included: subtle animations, tap feedback, and expo-haptics for meaningful touches.

 No dead UI: if a button is disabled, it must look disabled and explain why.

 If an image was provided, all visual details must be faithfully recreated.

4️⃣ RESPONSIVENESS & ACCESSIBILITY

 Layout works across all iPhone devices, from SE → Pro Max.

 Safe areas respected (status bar, notch, Dynamic Island).

 All tappables are at least 44dp with hitSlop if smaller.

 accessible and accessibilityLabel applied to important elements.

 Text scales properly with system font size settings.

 No clipped or overflowing text/images at any device size.

5️⃣ PERFORMANCE

 Lists (FlatList, SectionList) use keys and virtualization correctly.

 No unnecessary re-renders (use React.memo or hooks where helpful).

 Images explicitly sized (no unbounded growth).

 Heavy computations are memoized or moved out of render.

 Animations are smooth at 60fps without lag.

6️⃣ OUTPUT DELIVERY FORMAT

 Begins with shell commands for file creation/update.

 Provides entire file contents for every file.

 Ends with a Run & Verify block:

npx expo-doctor
npx tsc --noEmit
npm run lint   # if ESLint is configured
npx expo start -c


 Includes a short Assumptions & Decisions note explaining invented wiring or design choices.

 Includes a short How It Wires Together note describing how the feature integrates.

7️⃣ ABSOLUTE NO-GOS

❌ Returning incomplete code.
❌ Using placeholders or leaving empty stubs.
❌ Ignoring provided images or failing to recreate them faithfully.
❌ Cutting corners on polish (no gradients, no shadows, no animations).
❌ Delivering code that compiles with warnings or errors.
❌ Copying from any external source not explicitly provided.

8️⃣ DEFINITION OF SUCCESS

✅ Code compiles and runs flawlessly in Expo Go.
✅ TypeScript passes with no errors.
✅ Output includes shell commands + full files.
✅ Visuals match references or images exactly.
✅ Premium polish is applied (animations, gradients, haptics).
✅ Layout works across all devices, respecting safe areas.
✅ Accessibility built in.
✅ Performance optimized.
✅ Explanatory notes included.
✅ The feature is immediately usable and shippable.

🚨 REMEMBER:
This checklist is mandatory. If even one box is not checked, you must fix the issue before responding.
Only when every requirement is satisfied can you deliver the final answer.

This brings all three (Summary, Initialization, Quality Check) to the same long, strict, production-ready level.
