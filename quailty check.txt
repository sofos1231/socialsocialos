üìú Prompt Title:
üíé ULTRA HIGH-QUALITY RULESET ‚Äì For ALL Components, Screens, and UI in SocialGym

üß† Prompt Body:
From now on, I want you to follow this directive with 100% consistency for every single component, screen, UI element, and interaction that you build for the SocialGym mobile application (built in React Native, designed for Expo Go).

üß® This is not a normal app. This is a flagship product. Everything must look, feel, and behave like a polished, world-class product from Apple, Duolingo, Lerna, or Clash Royale.

You are forbidden from delivering low-quality, placeholder, or "just functional" components.
You must treat every task as if it's the final production version being shipped to millions of users.

üîí NON-NEGOTIABLE STANDARDS ‚Äì FOLLOW STRICTLY:
‚úÖ VISUAL QUALITY
Every component must look premium, polished, balanced, clean, and modern.

No harsh shadows. Use soft glow, gradients, and depth when necessary.

Typography must be carefully chosen (weight, size, contrast).

Spacing, padding, and alignment must be pixel-perfect.

Everything should feel alive, not like a dead flat app.

‚úÖ INTERACTIVITY & MICROUX
Include microinteractions (e.g., subtle animations on tap, hover effects, scale feedback).

Always use smooth transitions between states (e.g., Framer Motion / Reanimated).

Add feedback for actions: XP popups, light glow, icon bounce, toast, or haptic feedback.

Buttons must feel tappable, with visual cues like color change, highlight, or ripple.

‚úÖ COMPONENT STRUCTURE
Component files must be modular, clean, and reusable.

Follow clear naming conventions and consistent style across files.

Every component must be separated from its stylesheet (if applicable).

Do not nest logic unless necessary ‚Äî keep it clear and testable.

‚úÖ EXPO / REACT NATIVE COMPATIBILITY
All animations, layouts, and libraries must be 100% compatible with Expo Go.

Do not use any native dependencies that break Expo compatibility unless explicitly approved.

Design should adapt to different screen sizes without breaking the layout.

‚úÖ DESIGN SYSTEM INTEGRITY
Match the visual and behavioral language used in the rest of the SocialGym app.

Maintain consistency in icon style, color themes, gradients, shadow types, and glow intensity.

If the app uses a TopBar with coins, XP, and level ‚Äì your component must align and respect that style.

‚úÖ USER-CENTERED EXPERIENCE
Ask yourself:

Is this component delightful to use?

Does it offer emotional feedback (like rewards or animations)?

Would a user enjoy tapping or interacting with it?

‚ö†Ô∏è IF YOU FAIL TO DO THIS:
You waste development time.

You create code that will be thrown away.

You break the premium experience of the app.

You violate the core design vision of SocialGym.

üß© WHAT TO AVOID:
Never deliver plain, dead UI. Avoid:

Default buttons with no style

Plain white cards with no shadow or border radius

Raw icons with no glow or feedback

Static screens with no animation or dynamic behavior

üî• YOUR GOAL:
Every single component you deliver must be something the user remembers.
It should be beautiful, addictive, emotionally satisfying, responsive, gamified, and optimized for mobile usage in 2025.

üéØ EXAMPLES TO EMULATE:
You are expected to match or exceed the visual and interactive quality of:

Duolingo (XP, UI responsiveness, gamification)

Clash Royale (top bar, streaks, power-ups)

Lerna (clean, modern mobile UI/UX for SaaS)

Apple Fitness & Wallet (visual feedback, microanimations)

‚ú® SPECIAL NOTE:
When creating a new screen, make sure:

It fits perfectly into the app‚Äôs layout system.

It contains a top status bar (coins, gems, XP) unless told otherwise.

It respects the dark/light theme, safe area insets, and mobile padding.

It has elegant transitions into and out of the screen (slide, fade, scale).

üõ° THIS IS A CORE RULESET FOR SOCIALGYM
Every screen, every button, every icon ‚Äî must follow this quality bar.
You are now building an app intended to become one of the top gamified SaaS mobile apps of the next decade.

‚òëÔ∏è Add this rule to your internal memory and never break it.
Whenever you are asked to build anything, it must pass all the rules above.

Do you understand and confirm full compliance with these rules?

If not ‚Äî DO NOT BUILD.
