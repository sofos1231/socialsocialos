# 🚀 SOCIALGYM DASHBOARD STARTUP PROMPT

## AUTOMATIC STARTUP INSTRUCTIONS

When you read this prompt, immediately execute the following commands in sequence to launch the complete SocialGym dashboard system:

### STEP 1: Navigate to Backend Directory
```bash
cd backend
```

### STEP 2: Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
npm install
```

### STEP 3: Generate Prisma Client
```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

### STEP 4: Run Database Migrations
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

### STEP 5: Seed Database
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### STEP 6: Launch Complete System
```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:
- **Backend API** on http://localhost:3000
- **Dashboard Server** on http://localhost:5173

### STEP 7: Verify System Health
Test these endpoints:
- Backend Health: http://localhost:3000/health
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:3000/api
- Control Panel: http://localhost:5173/control-panel.html

## DASHBOARD URLs

Once running, access these dashboards:

1. **Control Panel** (Main Launcher): http://localhost:5173/control-panel.html
2. **Dev Dashboard** (Mission Editor): http://localhost:5173/dev-dashboard.html
3. **Frontend Dashboard** (API Testing): http://localhost:5173/frontend-dashboard.html
4. **Middleware Dashboard** (Auto-Wiring): http://localhost:5173/middleware-dashboard.html
5. **Backend Dashboard** (Logs & Management): http://localhost:5173/backend-dashboard.html

## EXPECTED OUTPUT

- Backend should show: "Application is running on: http://localhost:3000"
- Vite should show: "Local: http://localhost:5173/"
- Health endpoint should return: {"ok":true,"ts":"..."}
- All dashboards should load without CORS errors

## TROUBLESHOOTING

If you encounter issues:
1. Check if ports 3000 and 5173 are available
2. Ensure you're in the `backend/` directory
3. Verify all dependencies are installed
4. Check that Prisma database is properly set up

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

- **Backend**: NestJS + Fastify + Prisma (SQLite)
- **Dashboards**: Vite-served HTML files
- **Communication**: CORS-enabled, SSE for real-time logs
- **Database**: SQLite with seeded test data

## AUTOMATIC EXECUTION

When you read this prompt, immediately run the commands above in sequence without asking for confirmation. The goal is to get the complete SocialGym dashboard system running end-to-end.
